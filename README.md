# notJustHtml-searchEngine
A prototype of a domain specific search engine. I build it with the intention of crawling the web for malware, but it can do all sorts of interesting things, like looking for images that have geotags on them or images that are similar to images in a certain search set.

## To do
* The rating of a link should also depend on the previous link

## Low priority

## Long term
* Reorganize code into modules (so that the graph program can use the same type definitions)
* Implement something like pageRank
* Integrate Virustotal
